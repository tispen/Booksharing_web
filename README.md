# Booksharing_web
database mysql+web(php, html, css)

This is a web application that allows users to share their printed books, 
get points for it and spend them on books from a large list of the service's library, 
formed from books by the same users.

The web application is designed to work with two types of users: readers (clients), administrator (resource owner).
For readers (customers): 
1) the web application allows you to send a request to the administrator to add a book; 
2) view all the books that are currently available for order; 
3) send a request to the administrator to receive a book from the service library; 
4) view the number of points in the account. 

For the administrator (the owner of the resource): 
1) the web application allows you to manage readers' requests to add and remove a literary publication, 
2) register a user in the system. 

the site consists of two parts: information, where information about the project is stored, and a personal account.
